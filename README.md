# Food-Recognition-and-Calorie-Estimation
# Overview
This project is a deep learning-based application that recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content, allowing users to track their dietary intake and make healthier food choices. The model leverages InceptionV3, a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification, and has been trained on the Food-101 Dataset to classify various food items.

# Features
Image Recognition: Identifies food items in images with high accuracy.
Calorie Estimation: Provides an estimated calorie count based on the recognized food item.
Data Augmentation: Utilizes data augmentation techniques for better model generalization.
Transfer Learning: Uses InceptionV3 with pre-trained weights to reduce training time and improve accuracy.

# Dataset Preparation
Download the Food-101 dataset from Kaggle.

Extract and structure the dataset as follows:

├── food-101
    ├── images
    ├── meta
Prepare training and testing sets using train.txt and test.txt files from the meta directory.

# Usage
Training the Model: Run the training script to start training the model:

python train_model.py
Prediction: Use the provided predict_food_and_calories function to predict food items and estimate their calories. Example:
img_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
predicted_food, calories = predict_food_and_calories(img_path)
print(f"Predicted Food Item: {predicted_food}, Estimated Calories: {calories}")

# Model Architecture
The model is based on InceptionV3 with additional layers for improved accuracy:

GlobalAveragePooling2D
Dense Layer with ReLU activation
Dropout Layer for regularization
Dense Layer with softmax for classification
# Results
The model achieves high accuracy in recognizing food items and provides estimated calorie content, making it a valuable tool for dietary tracking.
